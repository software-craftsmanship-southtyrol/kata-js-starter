# Test setup with Mocha and TypeScript

This is a simple setup that allows to write mocha tests with TypeScript.

## Setup

Make sure your local setup meets the following requirements:

```
"node": ">= 4.2.1 <= 5"
"npm": ">= 3"
```

Then install dependencies.

```
$ npm i
```

## Run

Write your code and tests within the `src` folder. Test files should have the `*.spec.ts` suffix.

Run your tests with

```
$ npm run watch:test
```

...for continuous running or simply

```
$ npm test
```

..for executing them once.

Enjoy :smiley:!
